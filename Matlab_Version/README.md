# This library is for Constraint Consistent Learning (CCL)
# We have provided three demos to demonstrate the toolbox:
# 1) demo_toy_example_2D.m
# 2) demo_2_link_arm.m
# 3) demo_with_deal_data.m

# Details of the methodologies, please refer to:

# Towell, M. Howard, and S. Vijayakumar. IEEE International Conference Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2010.
# H.-C. Lin, M. Howard, and S. Vijayakumar. IEEE International Conference Robotics and Automation, 2015

Good luck!
Have fun!
