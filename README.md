The Constraint Consistent Learning (CCL) Library implements a family of data-driven methods that are capable of (i) learning state-independent and -dependent constraints, (ii) decomposing the behaviour of redundant systems into task- and null-space parts, and (iii) uncovering the underlying null space control policy.

We have provided three demos to demonstrate the toolbox:
1) demo_toy_example_2D.m
2) demo_2_link_arm.m
3) demo_with_deal_data.m
